# Algorithms and Data Structures

This repository is a collection of algorithms and data structures that I use in competitive programming. I will replenish it as needed. Where it makes sense, I tried to write in the stl-style.

The code is written in C++17. When writing the code, I followed
the [Google style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).
