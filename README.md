# Useful Algorithms and Data Structures

This repository is dedicated to structures and algorithms that I found interesting and useful. It is assumed that it
will be replenished over time.

The code is written in C++17. When writing the code, I followed the Google style
guide: https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html
